### Email Notifications

## üöÄ READY FOR PRODUCTION?

**YES** - for basic registration workflows:
- ‚úÖ Players can register for tournaments
- ‚úÖ Admins can configure registration settings
- ‚úÖ Admins can view who registered
- ‚úÖ Waitlist system works
- ‚úÖ Invite requests are captured

**NO** - if you need:
- ‚ùå Email notifications
- ‚ùå Payment processing
- ‚ùå Admin approval workflows
- ‚ùå Advanced invite management

## üí° RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### High Priority (For Production)
1. Replace `alert()` with proper toast notifications
2. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
3. Implement admin action APIs (approve/reject/promote)
4. Add loading states to all buttons

### Medium Priority (For Better UX)
1. Email notification system (Resend integration)
2. Payment integration (Stripe)
3. Export registrations to CSV
4. Registration deadline/cutoff date

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Bulk operations (invite multiple, export multiple)
2. Registration analytics dashboard
3. Automated waitlist promotion
4. Custom email templates
