## üí° Design Decisions

1. **Cost Storage**: Stored in cents (integer) to avoid floating-point precision issues
2. **Status Enums**: Using database enums for type safety and consistency
3. **Waitlist Positioning**: Simple integer position, recalculated on removals
4. **Payment Flow**: Registration created first, payment marked PENDING for PAID tournaments
5. **Auto-reload**: Dashboard reloads after actions to show updated state immediately

## üìù Notes

- All registration APIs require authentication via Clerk
- Validation happens server-side to prevent tampering
- Waitlist notifications (24hr expiry) not yet implemented
- Email system (Resend) integration pending
- Stripe payment flow is stubbed with TODOs
- Admin invite/management UI is next major feature
