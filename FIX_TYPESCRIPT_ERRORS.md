# Fix TypeScript Errors - Action Required

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The TypeScript errors you're seeing are because the **Prisma client hasn't been regenerated** after the database migration.

### Errors:
```
Property 'tournamentRegistration' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'
Property 'tournamentInvite' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'
Property 'inviteRequest' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'
Property 'tournamentWaitlist' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'
Property 'registrationStatus' does not exist on type 'Tournament'
Property 'registrationType' does not exist on type 'Tournament'
etc...
```

## ✅ Solution

You need to **stop the dev server and regenerate the Prisma client**:

### Steps:

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Why This Is Needed

When you ran the SQL migration in Supabase, you added:
- 4 new tables (TournamentRegistration, TournamentInvite, InviteRequest, TournamentWaitlist)
- 6 new fields to the Tournament table

But the Prisma TypeScript client still has the **old** schema. Running `npx prisma generate` will:
- Read `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Generate updated TypeScript types in `node_modules/.prisma/client`
- Add the new models and fields to the Prisma client

## ✅ What I Fixed

I already fixed these issues:
- ✅ Changed `clerkId` → `clerkUserId` in all registration API routes
- ✅ Fixed the `now` variable error in dashboard

## 🔍 After Prisma Generate

Once you run `npx prisma generate` and restart, all TypeScript errors will disappear and the registration system will be fully functional!

## 📝 Quick Verification

After restarting, test:
1. Go to `/tournaments` → Edit tournament → Registration Settings tab
2. Set to OPEN and FREE
3. Save
4. Go to `/dashboard` as player
5. Click "Register Now"
6. Should work! ✅

**Status:** Waiting for `npx prisma generate` to be run.
